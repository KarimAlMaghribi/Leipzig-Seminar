# Einführung zu TRIZ

## Grundsätzliches

* TRIZ als systematische Analysemethodik
  - Kurzschema "Spezifisches Problem - Abstraktes Problem" (Koltze/Souchkov,
    S. 15)    
  - Parallelität von spezifischer Lösung und Vorgehensmethodik (allgemeine
    Lösung in ARIZ-Workflow.png und der Zusammenhang zum "Stand der Technik"
* TRIZ in Beispielen
  - Das Beispiel "Blitzschutz einer Radarstation" aus ariz85c.pdf
  - Beispiele aus dem TRIZ-Trainer
* TRIZ, Patentrecherchen und der "Stand der Technik"

## Material zu TRIZ

**Educating the Edisons of the 21st Century**
- Fellowship Repository of educational materials on the Theory of Inventive
  Problem Solving (TRIZ) as part of National Senior Fellowship of Professor

## Wie TRIZ lehren - Karl Koltze in (Belski u.a. 2018, S.19)

The teaching experience and exam results show the following sequence of
well-accepted methods to those with increasing application problems among the
undergraduate students of the 4th semester:
* Functional Model
* Resource Analysis
* Feature Transfer
* Ideality
* Root Conflict Analysis (RCA+)
* Contradiction Analysis, Technical and Physical Contradiction
* Solving a Physical Contradiction with Separation Principles
* Smart Little Dwarfs

These tools are taught to the students almost in this order. When looking at
the application in student projects and theses, particular attention is paid
to the following points, some of which are also essential criteria for
grading:

* We attach great importance to the description of the goal in the sense of
  ideality.
* We attach great importance to an extensive resource analysis.
* When a goal conflict arises in the requirements for the technical system we
  attach great importance to the formulation of the Physical (!) Contradiction
  and expect its entire solution using a Separation Principle.
* The Root Conflict Analysis (RCA+) is often used for problem analysis by the
  students, but the innovative potential of any conflict solution shown in the
  RCA+ is often overlooked or ignored and should be taken up for an innovative
  solution.
* The Function Model is eagerly used, but the use of the contradiction
  analysis based on that model must be forced on the students by the
  supervisor.

## Main phases and steps of the innovation project in the course (ebenda,
   Pavel Livotov an der HS Offenburg)

Phase 1. Innovation strategy definition

* Initial situation analysis
* Function analysis of the product and customer’s process mapping
* Capturing solution-neutral customer needs (benefits)
* Evaluation of market potential of benefits as innovation tasks
* Selection of innovation tasks for the innovation strategy

Phase 2. Innovation concept development

* Systematic idea generation with TRIZ
* Creation of innovation concepts through combining ideas concepts
* Evaluation of innovative solution concepts
* Optimisation of the solution concepts
* Choice of the optimal innovation concept for the implementation
